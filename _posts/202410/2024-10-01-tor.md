Most of you know that the The Onion Network or ToR is the backbone of the Dark Web. First developed by the US Navy to hide their online activity, it is now an open-source project available to all via the ToR Project . Many people believe that their activities’ online through the ToR Network are safe and anonymous. In fact, most people make the assumption they are anonymous while using the ToR network and, as a result, make fatal mistakes

This week a German publication reported that German law enforcement had found a way to de-anonymize people on the ToR network. This information received a fair amount of press, but it is really old news. Over a decade ago, the National Security Administration (NSA) in the US, pioneered this de-anonymizing technique 

It’s not easy and it can be expensive but it is possible to determine your identity if you traverse the ToR network. This applies if you use ToR to visit a regular Internet site, but NOT if you remain within the ToR network. The key to de-anonymizing you is correlating your packet data between entry and exit nodes.
